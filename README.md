# Meta Environment Project Lith

## Elen

My first turing complete metaenvironment written in Awk,
here for occasional reference and posterity.

## Lith00

Lith00 has been moved into its own subdirectory,
as all iterations will be (for now).
I have decided to pursue a different path
for the interpreter as I believe the memory system
cannot even bear its own weight.
