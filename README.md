# Lith: Test-Type Meta Environment

Lith is the successor to Elen,
recounting many of its ideas
(predominantly that of having typed memory cells),
but written in C instead of Awk.

In its current state, Lith is not only not Turing-complete,
it is missing major functionality and any amount of test code.
That will not be the case for much longer,
for a time scale of, hopefully, only a few hours.
